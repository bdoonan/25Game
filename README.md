# 25Game
Currently a work in progress. This program will have the player play the irish card game of 25. The player will select the number of players and each player will be dealt 5 cards. Each player will play one card and the person who winds that hand will get 5 points. This will continue with new hands being dealt after all 5 cards are played until one player reaches 25. I would like to add graphics and images rather than the player just playing through text.

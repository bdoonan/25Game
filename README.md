# 25Game
Currently a work in progress. This program will have the player play the irish card game of 25. The player will select the number of players and each player will be dealt 5 cards. Each player will play one card and the person who winds that hand will get 5 points. This will continue with new hands being dealt after all 5 cards are played until one player reaches 25. The problems I have to solve with my program right now are the rotating starting player as right now the starting player is always the user. I would also like to add graphics and images rather than the player just playing through text, but this will be after I get the whole game working.
